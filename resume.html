<h2>Work experience</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Personal assistant</h3>
    <li> <i>Furuboda Yngsjö</i> (2021-2023)</li>
    <p>In this work, I provide support in all conceivable everyday situations that the <br /> care recipient cannot do by themselves. I adapt easily and listen to the needs that<br /> the individual has and motivate before things that may seem difficult or troublesome <br /> for my care recipient.</p>

    <h3>Student assistant</h3>
    <li> <i>Sånnaskolan Åhus</i> (2020-2021)</li>
    <p>I worked in 4th grade to support specific students. My tasks varied between the different <br /> school subjects, but with the same goal. Motivating and supporting the students to participate, <br />curiosity and initiative were some of the goals we had.</p>

    <h3>Student assistant</h3>
    <li> <i>Norretullskolan Kristianstad</i> (2019)</li>
    <p>This is a special needs school that does not include basic subjects, but training <br /> on everyday situations that should support them to become independent based on their abilities.</p>

    <h3>Service and sales</h3>
    <li><i>Clas Ohlson Stockholm</i> (2012-2015)</li>
    <p> My priority apart from sales and merchandise, was for the customer's needs. <br /> I made sure that customers left the store satisfied, throug needs analysis and help to find products <br /> or solutions they were looking for.</p>
